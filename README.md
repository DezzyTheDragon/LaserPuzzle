<h1>LaserPuzzle</h1>
<p>This is a prototype for a simple laser puzzle game. The goal is to access the teleporter in the room to get to the next puzzle. There are several different colored lasers the player can use as well as cubes and mirrors that redirect the laser. Some puzzles contain colored glass and when the laser is shot through it the laser color changes.</p>
<p>The purpose for this project was to experiment and learn how to use Unreal Engine 5. I learned how to utilize the editor, how Blueprints work and how all the various components work together and interact with each other.</p>
